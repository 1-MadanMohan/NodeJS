Step	What to Do	Why
1	Define all your functions first --->	Clean and organized
2	At the end, use module.exports = { ... }  --->	So you export one single object
3	Never assign module.exports multiple times --->	Each assignment overwrites the previous one
4	Optional: You can alias names if needed	Like { M: multiply } if you want short keys



Use moduele.exports one time, becoz it overwrites the previous one
But you can use exports.function() multiple times
