😄 Glad it worked! Here's what we did — plain and simple:

---

### 🔧 **Problem**

Git was trying to **digitally sign your commits** using GPG — but you **didn't have a private key**, so it failed every time.

---

### ✅ **What We Did**

We told Git:

> **“Stop signing commits — I just want to commit and push!”**

By running this command:

```bash
git config --global commit.gpgSign false
```

That disabled GPG signing globally on your system — no more errors, no more headaches.

---

### 🎉 Result

Now Git:

* ✅ Commits your changes normally
* ✅ Pushes them to GitHub
* ❌ Doesn’t try to sign with GPG anymore

---

If you ever want to re-enable signing or learn how to use GPG properly (with the green ✅ Verified badge on GitHub), just let me know.
Otherwise, you’re good to **focus on building and shipping code**. 🚀

Let me know if you want help cleaning up, pushing, or organizing your repo next.
